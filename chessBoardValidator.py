#A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white king. Each player can only have at most 16 pieces, 
#at most 8 pawns, and all pieces must be on a valid space from '1a' to '8h'; that is, a piece canâ€™t be on space '9z'. 
#The piece names begin with either a 'w' or 'b' to represent white or black, followed by 'pawn', 'knight', 'bishop', 'rook', 'queen', 
#or 'king'. This function should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper chess board.
